# @chrisblossom/eslint-config

This is my personal ESLint config I've extended from [Airbnb's](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base) among other plugins. This package is intended to be used in combination with [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest), and [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow).

## About

I've found some of Airbnb's rules too be too restrictive. This package is not guaranteed to follow semver.
